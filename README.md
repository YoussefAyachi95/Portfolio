# Porfolio Project

# UIB Portfolio Project

---

### Idea

This is a simple Porfolio with some of my projects done this last couple months. It's a native CSS only Portfolio.


### What I used:

- Figma: For making a wireframe so I can design my idea. I used some Figma plugins like <b>Mockup</b> for mobile/laptop view mockups and <b>Remove BG</b> to remove some of my image's background.
- GIMP: For editing some images.
- Online tools: Like LogoAI for making a logo, DEVICON for icons and DRAWkit for Vectors.


### Fonts:
- Albert Sans (Google Fonts)

### Colors:

- Background: #FEFAF6
- Text: #323780
- Borders/Hover: #F14C36
- Gradient: <a href="https://codepen.io/LauraRobertson/pen/eBjrgj">https://codepen.io/LauraRobertson/pen/eBjrgj</a>
